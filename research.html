        <h3>Sealing and Healing Behaviour of Rock Salt Fractures</h3>
        <p><em>PhD Research, September 2021 – Present</em></p>
        
        <p>
            My PhD project investigates the mechanical-chemical evolution of rock salt fractures, combining experiments and 
            numerical modeling to study fracture geometry evolution and mechanical healing. This research is funded by the 
            Chinese Scholarship Council for Doctoral Education (Grant No. 202106440022) and the Cementegrity Project under 
            the ACT program (Accelerating CCS Technologies) through the Horizon 2020 framework (Grant No. 691712).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Dissolution and Transport Processes:</strong></p>
        <p>
            I design and conduct flow-through visualization experiments to study how fluid concentration, flow rate, and 
            initial geometry influence the transition between diffusion- and advection-dominated regimes in rock salt fracture 
            dissolution. Using advanced image processing with MATLAB and Avizo, combined with 3D surface reconstruction in 
            MeshLab and SolidWorks, I quantify aperture changes and interface roughness evolution. These experimental findings 
            are complemented by reactive-transport simulations in COMSOL to understand the coupling between flow and dissolution 
            under stress conditions.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Fracture Healing and Strength Recovery:</strong></p>
        <p>
            I conduct long-term healing experiments (up to one year) on rock salt fractures, followed by direct shear testing 
            to evaluate shear strength recovery. This work focuses on quantifying changes in internal friction angle and 
            stick-slip behavior. Microscopy techniques are employed to examine microstructural evolution before and after healing, 
            providing insights into the healing mechanisms at different scales.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Constitutive Modeling:</strong></p>
        <p>
            I have extended an elastic-plastic constitutive model to incorporate the healing behavior of rock salt fractures. 
            This advanced model is implemented through user-defined Fortran subroutines (UMAT) in ABAQUS, enabling predictive 
            simulations of fracture evolution under coupled hydro-mechanical-chemical conditions. The model captures the complex 
            interplay between stress, fluid flow, dissolution, and healing processes.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Research Impact:</strong></p>
        <p>
            These findings contribute to the design of safer and more reliable rock salt caverns for large-scale energy storage 
            applications, supporting the energy transition by enabling efficient storage of hydrogen, compressed air, and other 
            energy carriers in subsurface salt formations.

        <h3>Hydraulic Fracturing in Coal Measure Shale Reservoirs</h3>
        <p><em>Master's Research, December 2018 – January 2021</em></p>
        
        <p>
            My Master's research focused on understanding fracture initiation and propagation geometry in the Longtan Formation 
            coal measure shale reservoir in the Sichuan Basin. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation 
            of China (NSFC), Grant No. 51904318, under the project "Fracture Propagation Mechanism of Complex Coal-Bearing Shales."
        </p>

        <p><strong>Experimental Investigation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tested mechanical properties of various lithological rocks using GCTS equipment</li>
            <li>Characterized vertical variations in lithology, in-situ stress, and mechanical parameters</li>
            <li>Conducted true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experiments on large-scale samples (30×30×30 cm) of coal-shale interbedded formations</li>
            <li>Investigated how interlayer in-situ stress differences influence fracture initiation and propagation geometry</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Numerical Modeling:</strong></p>
        <p>
            I developed a three-dimensional hydraulic fracture model in ABAQUS incorporating geological features through a 
            coupled seepage-stress-damage approach using a Cohesive Zone Model. This model accounts for the complex interaction 
            between fluid injection, rock deformation, and fracture propagation in heterogeneous formations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The research revealed critical insights into how lithological contrasts and stress variations control fracture 
            height growth and lateral extent in coal measure shale reservoirs, with important implications for optimizing 
            hydraulic fracturing operations in these complex geological settings.
